/**
 * One resume at a time per execution.
 *
 * This is the one thing storage cannot provide, and without it nothing in this package holds
 * together: two workers resuming the **same** execution both replay it, each believing it is
 * discovering the commands the execution produces, and those commands go out twice. The journal
 * does not prevent that — it faithfully records whatever it is given, twice included. The
 * `DbalEventStore` docblock has said so from the start; on the Symfony side it is a Messenger
 * middleware backed by `symfony/lock`, here it is the cache's atomic lock.
 *
 * **Why a closure rather than a job middleware.** A Laravel middleware hooks onto a job class, and
 * this package provides none: these are stores. The integration package will have some, and all it
 * needs is to wrap its `handle()` with this. An artisan command or a hand-written worker gets
 * there too, without having to inherit anything.
 *
 * **Why `LockProvider` and not the cache.** It is the only contract this lock needs, and it comes
 * from `illuminate/contracts`, which `illuminate/database` already pulls in.
 *
 * ⚠ **The type filters nothing, contrary to what this block used to claim.** On Laravel 12, nine
 * stores implement `LockProvider` — `file` included, and it does lock correctly across
 * processes — among them `NullStore`, whose `NoLock::acquire()` returns `true` unconditionally.
 * Measured over twenty resumes of one execution and four `queue:work`: `database` and `file`
 * leave no overlap at all, `array` and `null` leave fifteen out of twenty, at concurrency 4.
 * The choice of store is therefore the caller's, and it is the only one in this package that
 * silently makes a journal diverge when it is wrong.
 *
 * ```php
 * $lock->around($executionId, fn() => $runner->resume($executionId));
 * ```
 *
 * **Why the wait is written here rather than delegated to `Lock::block()`.** `block()` calls a
 * **global** `now()`, which only a full Laravel application defines — `illuminate/support` only
 * publishes it under its own namespace. A package that uses it works inside an application and
 * breaks in a standalone worker or a test, which is the worst of both worlds: the failure only
 * happens where nobody is looking. Eight lines of bounded wait carry no such dependency.
 *
 * ponytail: polling every 100 ms rather than a notification. A resume lock is held for the length
 * of one workflow step; if contention ever justifies it, Redis knows how to notify.
 *
 * ponytail: wait bounded by `$waitSeconds`. A worker that waits for its turn is what we want; a
 * worker that waits indefinitely on a lock that a dead process never released is not — hence the
 * TTL, which is the real safety net.
 *
 * @see \Gplanchat\Bridge\Dbal\Messenger\SingleResumeLockMiddleware the Symfony counterpart
